# Changelog

## 2026-08-08

- Added the Harmony NDK C++17 repository service and ArkTS N-API boundary.
- Added real repository discovery, initialization, directory navigation and folder
  picker integration without changing the terminal UI.
- Added HEAD, branch, packed-ref, remote, index v2/v3/v4 and working-tree status reads.
- Added linked worktree `commondir` support.
- Added host-native Git repository fixtures and native-service ArkTS tests.
- Added native loose-object reads and writes for blobs, trees and commits.
- Added packed commit, tree and blob object reads with pack index v1/v2 lookup and
  OFS_DELTA/REF_DELTA reconstruction.
- Added `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, `core.excludesFile` and default global
  ignore matching to status and `git add`.
- Added real `add`, `restore`, `reset`, `commit`, `diff`, `log`, `branch`, `switch` and
  `checkout -- <path>` behavior for local repositories.
- Added `git restore --source`, combined staged/working-tree restore, `git checkout -B`
  and `git switch -C` with first-parent revision selection.
- Added index v4 compressed-path reads for status, staged and working-tree diff, and
  native operations that normalize updated indexes to v2.
- Kept network transport and PTY process support explicitly outside this milestone.
